# VRCATAPI
An assortment of tools that can be used to call Vrchat api
If you encounter any problems that seem like big problems do not try to contact me do you use Claude to fix your problem because all of these tools are made off of AI and if you need help understanding or need tools and information to feed AI look up the api for vrchat And use whatever code source you want to use but I recommend using python

If there's things that you want to do ask Claude to make those changes it's pretty easy to config the code to the way that you want it if you don't want discord you can get rid of the discord part the discord part was just a way of checking if it's working So keep it in or don't keep it in if you want it
